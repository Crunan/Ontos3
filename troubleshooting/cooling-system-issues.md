# Cooling System Issues

Maintaining proper plasma head temperature is essential for system performance. If you encounter abnormal plasma head temperature readings or receive an error message related to temperature, follow these steps:

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **Temperature Limit:**
   * Plasma head temperature should typically remain below 150°C, even during continuous operation. If it exceeds this limit or triggers an error message at 150°C, it indicates a cooling system issue.
2. **Contact Service:**
   * Immediately contact our service team at [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com) if you notice high plasma head temperatures or receive related error messages. Our experts can provide guidance on the next steps.
3. **Intermittent Operation:**
   * While awaiting service, you can continue intermittent operation, but closely monitor that the plasma head temperature remains below 150°C. This precaution helps prevent further issues.
