# Gas Flow Issues

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **Valves Not Turned On:**
   * Ensure that all gas supply valves are turned on.
   * Check gas supply lines to verify proper flow.
2. **Gas Cylinder Empty:**
   * Confirm that gas cylinders are not empty.
   * Replace with full cylinders as needed.
3. **No Flow Setting in MFC#1:**
   * Set MFC#1 to a flow value of at least 5 SLPM.
   * This flow is necessary to activate the manifold outlet valve.
{% endhint %}

If the above steps do not resolve the gas flow issue, please contact our service team at [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com) for further assistance.

**Issue #2: Safety Interlock Issues:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Gas flow will automatically shut down if safety interlocks are open.
{% endhint %}

* Ensure that all safety interlocks are securely closed.

If the gas flow issue persists due to safety interlock problems, please contact our service team at [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com) for further assistance.

**Issue #3: If Gas Flow Still Does Not Control Properly:**

{% hint style="warning" %}
* An MFC (Mass Flow Controller) may be faulty.
* There could be a problem with the MFC controller.
* A fuse may be blown in the Main Control Module.
{% endhint %}
