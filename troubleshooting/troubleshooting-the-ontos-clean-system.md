# Troubleshooting the ONTOS Clean System



In the event of any process error during system operation, the ONTOS Clean interface provides tools to identify and address issues promptly. The Error Codes section within the interface displays specific error codes that correspond to encountered problems. Additionally, a red indicator light adjacent to the \[START PLASMA] button will illuminate during an error occurrence. This indicator remains illuminated even after acknowledging an error code.

To resolve issues and restore system functionality, either restarting the plasma operation or performing a system reset will clear the red indicator light. Refer to Table 3 below for a comprehensive list of error codes, accompanied by detailed descriptions of each error type. This troubleshooting resource aids in diagnosing and addressing problems effectively, ensuring the smooth operation of the ONTOS Clean system.

Below is a list of Error Codes with associated descriptions.
