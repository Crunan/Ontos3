# Wipe Down Critical Surfaces

During the wipe-down procedure, it's important to avoid contact with the guiding rail surfaces, as these surfaces contain lubrication that should not be removed. Here's how to properly clean the system:

1. **Preparation:** Before cleaning, ensure that the equipment is powered off and disconnected from the power source to prevent electrical hazards.
2. **Materials:** Use a clean room wipe, such as Texwipeâ„¢ TX 1008B or a similar product. These materials are designed to minimize the risk of scratching or leaving particles on the glass surface.
3. **Cleaning Solution:** Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with a concentration of at least 70%. IPA is an effective cleaning agent that evaporates quickly and leaves no residue. The wipe should not be soaked or dripping.
4. **Cleaning Process:**
   * Dampen the cloth or rag with a small amount of IPA.
   * Gently wipe the tempered glass panels and door using light pressure. Avoid using excessive force to prevent damage.
   * For stubborn stains or contaminants, you can slightly increase the pressure, but do not use abrasive materials or harsh chemicals.
5. **Interior Surfaces**: Wipe down all interior surfaces of the enclosure. For each of the following steps, repeat the wipe-down procedure as described in Step 4:
   * Inside the access door and the sill at the bottom of the door opening.
   * The polished mirror bottom panel underneath the stage.
   * The top surface of the Stage where the sample or substrate is placed.
   * The door at the front of the tool.
   * The touchscreen monitor (if applicable).
6. **Drying:** Allow the glass panels to air dry or use a clean, dry part of the cloth to gently pat them dry.
7. **Air Blow**: Begin by using clean dry air (CDA) or nitrogen (N2) to gently blow off the chuck surface. This helps remove loose particles without the risk of scratching.
8. **Repeat**: Repeat the prior step for air blow to ensure that any remaining particles are removed.
9. **Frequency:** Regularly inspect the glass panels for dirt, smudges, or residue. Clean them as needed or according to your equipment's maintenance schedule.
