# Wipe Down Critical Surfaces

During the wipe-down procedure, it's important to avoid contact with the guiding rail surfaces, as these surfaces contain lubrication that should not be removed. Here's how to properly clean the system:

1. **Air Blow**: Begin by using clean dry air (CDA) or nitrogen (N2) to gently blow off the chuck surface. This helps remove loose particles without the risk of scratching.
2. **Wipe with Isopropyl Alcohol**: Using a clean room wipe, such as Texwipeâ„¢ TX 1008B or a similar product, dampen the wipe with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA). The wipe should not be soaked or dripping.
3. **Interior Surfaces**: Wipe down all interior surfaces of the enclosure. For each of the following steps, repeat the wipe-down procedure as described in Step 2:
   * Inside the access door and the sill at the bottom of the door opening.
   * The polished mirror bottom panel underneath the stage. Note: With the ONTOS _Clean_ powered off, the stage motors are de-energized, allowing the stage to be freely moved for cleaning.
   * The top surface of the Stage where the sample or substrate is placed.
   * The sliding doors at the front of the tool.
   * The touchscreen monitor (if applicable).
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the air blow procedure described in Step 1 to ensure that any remaining particles are removed.

By following these cleaning steps, you can help maintain the cleanliness and functionality of the ONTOS _Clean_ system. Please note that these steps are intended for routine cleaning. For more advanced maintenance or technical issues, it's recommended to rely on trained personnel who have completed the necessary training to ensure proper care and handling of the system.
