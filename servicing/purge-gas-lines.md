# Purge Gas Lines

Purging the gas lines is an important step to ensure that the gas delivery system is free from any air or contaminants. Here's a detailed guide on how to purge the gas lines for the ONTOS _Clean_ system:

1. **Enter Engineer Mode**: Launch the ONTOS _Clean_ software and navigate to the Service menu bar. From there, select "Engineer Mode" to access advanced settings.
2. **Disable Auto Tune**: In Engineer Mode, select the "Auto Tune" option to disable the Auto Tune function.
3. **Set RF Power to 0**: Make sure to set the Radio-Frequency (RF) power to 0 to ensure that the plasma is not activated during the purging process.
4. **Turn Off Auto Scan**: Under the "Settings" section, ensure that the "Auto Scan" option is turned off. This will prevent any automated scanning from occurring during the gas line purging.
5. **Prepare Gas Regulator**: Set the gas regulator for the replaced gas bottle to 20 PSI (1.4 bar) pressure. This pressure setting will aid in effectively purging the gas lines.
6. **Set Maximum Gas Flow**: In the ONTOS _Clean_ software, adjust the gas flow for the replaced gas to the maximum allowed value. Keep in mind that for gas #1 and #2, the maximum is 20 Standard Liters Per Minute (SLPM), while for gas #3 and #4, it is 0.3 SLPM.
7. **Start Plasma**: Select the "Start Plasma" button in the software. This step initiates the flow of the gas through the lines for purging.
8. **Wait for Purging**: Allow the gas to flow through the lines for a period of time. It's recommended to wait at least 1 second per meter of line length in the delivery gas line. This duration ensures that the gas lines are thoroughly purged of any air or contaminants.
