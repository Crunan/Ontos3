Maintenance for the OntosTT system is critical for ensuring optimal performance and longevity. It's important to note that many maintenance tasks are specialized and require training to be performed correctly. Users are limited in what they can do, and maintenance procedures that extend beyond the steps listed below necessitate undergoing the Maintenance Training Course provided by Ontos Equipment Systems. This course equips personnel with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively service and conduct preventative maintenance on the OntosTT system.

Outlined below are a couple of essential maintenance tasks that users can perform:

1. [**Cleaning and Dust Removal**](wipe-down-critical-surfaces.md): Regularly cleaning the exterior of the system, including control panels and any exposed components, helps prevent dust buildup that could affect performance. However, caution should be exercised to avoid dislodging any sensitive components.
2. [**Gas Cylinder Replacement**](changing-a-gas-bottle.md): Users can replace empty or depleted gas cylinders following guidelines provided in the system's manual. Always ensure proper handling and connections to prevent gas leaks or safety hazards.
