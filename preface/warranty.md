# Warranty

**GENERAL CONDITIONS OF WARRANTY**

This machine is warranted for 1 year against all defects in construction, parts and labor. The warranty begins on the date that the machine receives its final acceptance at the customerâ€™s site. This date is not to exceed 6 months beyond the delivery date of the machine, except when agreed in writing by OES or its agents, dealers, or representatives.

Any intervention or modification of parts or electronic control circuits carried out without the written permission of OES voids the warranty. In particular, any tampering with the adjustment screws, which are sealed with such products as wax or varnish, voids the warranty. Defective functioning resulting from incorrect adjustment or from disregarding the adjustment information is not covered by the warranty. Warranty clauses particular to each type of machine are given in the specific technical document and should be read carefully, particularly the information concerning the initial set-up of certain equipment.

**For certain pieces of equipment this warranty is only valid if the machine is returned to our workshop. If the service call is carried out on site the technician's travel expenses will be billed to the user.**&#x20;
