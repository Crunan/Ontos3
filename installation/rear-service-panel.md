**Gas Ports and Connections**

Proper gas connections are vital for the optimal functioning of the ONTOS _Clean_ system. Follow these guidelines for secure and efficient gas handling:

* **Gas Ports Location:** The back panel of the ONTOS _Clean_ houses four input gas ports and one output gas port (chuck vacuum).
* **Fitting Type:** The four input gas ports are equipped with ¼” Swagelok® compression fittings.
* **Gas Pressure:** Operate the four gases in the system at a pressure of 20 PSI (1.4 bar).
* **Recommended Gas Quality:** OES recommends the use of Ultra-High Purity (UHP) gases and point-of-use filters to ensure gas quality.
* **Flow Rate and Pressure Compatibility:** All gas flow rates should be capable of 50 SLPM at 20 PSI.
* **Regulator Installation:** Install a stainless-steel regulator with a maximum range of 0 to 100 PSI (0 to 6.9 bar) on the delivery source for each gas.
* **Shut-off Valve:** Additionally, consider installing a stainless-steel shut-off valve downstream of the regulator. This valve allows gas to be switched on/off without adjusting the regulator, enabling efficient bottle changes without extensive purging before plasma resumption.
* **Chase Installation:** If the delivery source is located in a chase, ensure the installation of a valve within the clean room area near the system connections.
