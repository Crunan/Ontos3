# Environmental Conditions

To ensure that the system operates within the specifications, it must be installed in the following conditions:

* In a clean room, minimum class 10,000 (ISO 7). Higher classification should be considered based on the user’s requirements, such as class 100 (ISO 5) for high-end applications.
* The room temperature must be held between 18°C (64°F) and 24°C (75°F).
* It is recommended that the system is placed in a laminar flow area with an airspeed of 0.3-0.5m/s (12-18 in/sec).
* The system must be connected to a proper exhaust system.
* The Control Rack must be able to slide all the way forward to be serviced. (e.g. Flexible Teflon lines for Gas lines)
