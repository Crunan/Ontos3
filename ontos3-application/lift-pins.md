# Lift Pins

The lift pins are used for loading and unloading a substrate onto the stage chuck.

#### The lift pins button is enabled by default after the stage is initialized.

#### Clicking the \[_**LIFT PINS**_] button while the button is enabled (green light is lit) will bring a loaded substrate onto the chuck.

#### Whenever the LIFT PINS is enabled, the chuck vacuum is automatically turned off, regardless of whether the manual vacuum button has been enabled.
