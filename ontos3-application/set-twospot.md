This sequence sets the coordinates of the Scanning function for a rectangular substrate. It allows to define a scanning area for the Plasma that is not necessarily the entire substrate surface, but can be a localized area, eventually off center (see Figure 67 and Figure 68 below for examples)

**WARNING: The laser (Class 2, < 1mW) can reflect off surfaces on the OntosTT, do not stare directly into beam of the laser source.**
