# Vacuum

### VACUUM <a href="#_toc54339778" id="_toc54339778"></a>

The chuck has a built-in vacuum which ensures the substrate from shifting during processing.

#### The Vacuum is turned off by default.

#### Clicking the \[_**VACUUM**_] button will turn the vacuum on for the chuck.

Note: _VACUUM_ will not turn on when the lift pins are enabled (green light is lit)
