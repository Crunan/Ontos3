# Manual Tuning

The ONTOS _Clean_ Surface Preparation System provides a manual tuning option that allows users to fine-tune the plasma performance by adjusting the tuner settings. This section outlines the steps to manually tune the system using the provided interface controls.

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **Initial State:** Ensure that the ONTOS _Clean_ system is powered on, and a recipe is loaded for operation.
2. **Begin Plasma**: [Start Plasma](../operator-mode/running-plasma.md).
3. **Locate the Manual Tuning Controls:** Within the Matchbox settings, locate the graphic representation of the tuner. If the system is in [Auto-tune](auto-tune.md), it will need to be disabled. Then on either side of the tuner graphic, you will find two arrow icons: a left arrow and a right arrow.
4. **Understand the Arrow Functions:** The left arrow is used to adjust the tuner settings in the direction of decreasing capacitance (towards 0%), while the right arrow is used to adjust the settings in the direction of increasing capacitance (towards 100%).
5. **Tuning Down (Left Arrow):** To fine-tune the plasma towards decreasing capacitance, click on the left arrow icon. Each click will make incremental adjustments to the tuner settings, leading to a reduction in capacitance.
6. **Tuning Up (Right Arrow):** To fine-tune the plasma towards increasing capacitance, click on the right arrow icon. Similar to tuning down, each click will result in incremental adjustments that increase the capacitance.
7. **Monitor Plasma Performance:** As you adjust the tuner settings using the manual arrows, closely monitor the plasma performance, reflected energy levels, and any other relevant indicators to assess the impact of the adjustments.
8. **Balance Performance:** The goal of manual tuning is to achieve a balanced and optimized plasma performance that meets the requirements of the specific recipe and process.
9. **Continuous Adjustment:** Depending on the recipe and process conditions, you may need to perform multiple clicks on the arrow icons to achieve the desired tuning outcome.
10. **Transition to Auto Tune:** If desired, you can transition from manual tuning to Auto Tune mode by toggling the switch above the tuner graphic. Auto Tune mode allows the system to make automatic adjustments to minimize reflected energy.

Using the manual tuning feature, you can fine-tune the plasma performance of the ONTOS _Clean_ system to ensure optimal operation. By making incremental adjustments in capacitance using the left and right arrow icons, you can achieve the desired plasma characteristics for your specific application.
