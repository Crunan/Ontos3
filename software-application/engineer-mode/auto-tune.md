# Auto Tune

The Auto Tune feature of the ONTOS _CLEAN_ allows the machine to automatically adjust its tuner settings to achieve optimal performance. This section outlines the steps to set up and use the Auto Tune mode.

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **Initial State:** Ensure that the ONTOS _CLEAN_ is powered on, and a recipe is loaded for operation.
2. **Begin Plasma**: [Start Plasma](../operator-mode/running-plasma.md).
3. **Select Auto Tune Mode:** Above the tuner graphic, you will find a toggle switch that allows you to select between Auto Tune and Manual mode. Click the toggle switch to set it to Auto Tune.
4. **Monitor Tuner Adjustment:** In Auto Tune mode, the system will continuously monitor the state of reflected energy during operation. It will make automatic adjustments to the tuner settings to minimize the reflected energy level.
5. **No Manual Adjustment:** When the Auto Tune mode is active, the manual tuner adjustment arrows will not be visible on the interface. The system will handle the tuner adjustments automatically.
6. **Observing Performance:** While the system is running in Auto Tune mode, monitor its performance to ensure that the reflected energy levels are being minimized effectively.
7. **Finishing Auto Tune:** The Auto Tune process will continue until the reflected energy level reaches a minimum value or stabilizes. The system will automatically adjust the tuner settings to achieve this.
8. **Transitioning Out of Auto Tune:** To transition out of Auto Tune mode and make [manual adjustments](manual-tuning.md), simply toggle the switch above the tuner graphic back to Manual mode.
