# Auto Start Scan

**Auto Start Scan**

The Auto Start Scan feature streamlines the workflow by enabling an automated initiation of the stage scan upon clicking the "Start Plasma" button. Additionally, this option ensures that the plasma is automatically turned off at the conclusion of the scan, enhancing operational efficiency.

Enabling the Auto Start Scan option empowers the system to perform the following actions:

* Automatically start the stage scan as soon as the "Start Plasma" button is activated.
* Automatically deactivate the plasma at the conclusion of the scan.

This integrated functionality simplifies the process for Operators and enhances the precision of the plasma treatment procedure. By automatically synchronizing the start and end points of the scan with the plasma activation and deactivation, this feature ensures consistent and accurate outcomes.

Once the Auto Start Scan setting is configured, Engineers with the appropriate level of access can preserve this selection within a recipe. The steps for saving this configuration can be found in sections 7.1.30 ("Save a New Recipe – Engineer Mode") and 7.1.33 ("Overwrite an Existing Recipe Configuration – Engineer Mode").

Incorporating the Auto Start Scan feature into your ONTOS Clean software utilization provides a streamlined and automated approach to initiating and concluding stage scans, contributing to a seamless and efficient user experience.
