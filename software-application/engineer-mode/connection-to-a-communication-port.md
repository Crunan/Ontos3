# Connection to a Communication Port



The ONTOS _CLEAN_ software streamlines the connection process by automatically remembering previously established communication ports for future use. However, if the connection is lost or if manual port selection is necessary, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Open the ONTOS _CLEAN_ software window.
2. Locate the dropdown menu labeled "Com Port" within the application interface.
3. From the dropdown menu, select an available and open communication port that corresponds to the desired hardware connection.
4. After selecting the appropriate port, click on the red \[CONNECT] button located in the interface.

The software will initiate the connection process to establish communication with the selected port. This step ensures the continuous flow of data and information between the ONTOS _CLEAN_ software and the associated hardware.
