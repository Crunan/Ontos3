# ðŸŸ¤ 2. Frame Assembly

**Section 2: Frame Assembly**&#x20;

In this section, we will provide you with important information about the frame assembly and the tempered glass panels used in your semiconductor equipment. Please read this section carefully to ensure the proper handling, maintenance, and cleaning of these components.

**2.1 Frame Assembly**

The frame assembly of your semiconductor equipment is designed to for the structural support and integrity of the system. It is constructed using high-quality materials to ensure stability and durability during operation.

**2.2 Tempered Glass Panels and Door**

The equipment features tempered glass panels and a door that offer transparency and visibility into the internal processes. Tempered glass is used for its strength and safety properties. It is important to note that while tempered glass is more resistant to breakage than standard glass, it is not indestructible. Avoid impacts or forceful contact with the glass panels to prevent potential damage.

1. **Locate the Handle:** Locate the handle attached to the tempered glass door. The handle is positioned near the center of the door.
2. **Grip the Handle:** Grasp the handle firmly with your hand.&#x20;
3. **Pull the Door:** Gently pull the handle down and towards you. The door should come to a comfortable rest at the bottom of the hinge.
4. **Perform Task:** Perform the necessary tasks inside the system while the tempered glass door remains open.
5. **Close the Door:** Once your tasks are completed, grasp the handle again and gently push the door back into its closed position.
6. **Verify Closure:** Ensure that the door is securely closed and properly aligned with the frame

**2.3 Electrostatic Discharge Port**

The ONTOS _Clean_ system is equipped with two Electrostatic Discharge Ports, providing connections for managing electrostatic discharge during operational processes. These ports serve as pathways for mitigating electrostatic charge buildup and ensuring the safety and integrity of the equipment and processed substrates.

**2.4 Cleaning Instructions**

Proper cleaning of the tempered glass panels will help maintain clear visibility and overall equipment functionality. Follow these guidelines for cleaning:

1. **Preparation:** Before cleaning, ensure that the equipment is powered off and disconnected from the power source to prevent electrical hazards.
2. **Materials:** Use a clean room rag or lint-free microfiber cloth. These materials are designed to minimize the risk of scratching or leaving particles on the glass surface.
3. **Cleaning Solution:** Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with a concentration of at least 70%. IPA is an effective cleaning agent that evaporates quickly and leaves no residue.
4. **Cleaning Process:**
   * Dampen the cloth or rag with a small amount of IPA.
   * Gently wipe the tempered glass panels and door using light pressure. Avoid using excessive force to prevent damage.
   * For stubborn stains or contaminants, you can slightly increase the pressure, but do not use abrasive materials or harsh chemicals.
5. **Drying:** Allow the glass panels to air dry or use a clean, dry part of the cloth to gently pat them dry.
6. **Frequency:** Regularly inspect the glass panels for dirt, smudges, or residue. Clean them as needed or according to your equipment's maintenance schedule.
