# ðŸ”´ 9. Crash Avoidance System



**Section 9: Crash Avoidance System (Optional)**

This section introduces the optional Crash Avoidance System, a specialized subsystem that augments the ONTOS _Clean_ capabilities by enhancing safety and precision during operation.

**9.1 System Overview**

The ONTOS _Clean_ system offers the optional integration of a Crash Avoidance System, providing an additional layer of safety and operational accuracy. This system comprises two towers housing a reflective laser sensor setup.

**9.2 Pre-Scan Collision Test**

The Crash Avoidance System features a pre-scan collision test mechanism. This test ensures the accuracy of Operator inputs before commencing operations. Specifically, it validates the setup of Gap and Thickness fields. The pre-scan collision test safeguards against potential errors that could result in collisions during operation.

**9.3 Imminent Crash Detection**

Should any discrepancies be detected during the pre-scan collision test, the Crash Avoidance System promptly identifies an imminent collision scenario. In response, it initiates an immediate halt of all motors, preventing any potential damage or unsafe conditions.

**9.4 Operator Interaction**

In the event of a detected imminent crash, the system engages the Operator interface to communicate the situation. The Operator is informed that the Laser has been tripped and is required to acknowledge the error. This interactive feedback loop ensures that the Operator is aware of the situation and takes necessary actions.

**9.5 Resumption of Operations**

Upon Operator acknowledgment of the error, the system returns to the Load position, preparing for another collision test. This streamlined process allows for quick resolution and readiness for subsequent operations.

The optional Crash Avoidance System when incorporated into a system allows users to have an extra layer of confidence when operating the ONTOS _Clean_, particularly during critical tasks.
