# ðŸš¦ Signal Tower

The light tower subsystem employs a trio of LED lights to convey information about the tool's operational status:

* A green light signifies that the Plasma is active and in operation.
* An amber light indicates that the system is in an idle state, ready to accept commands.
* A red light serves as a dual indicator, signaling either an error state or the presence of an open door.

This light tower's tri-color displayâ€”comprising green, amber, and redâ€”serves as an intuitive visual guide, succinctly communicating the current condition of the system.
