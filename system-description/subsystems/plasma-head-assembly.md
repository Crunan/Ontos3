# 🟣 Plasma Head Assembly

This module combines process gases and RF power to create a plasma glow discharge in a small chamber inside the head.

Excited “downstream” gas atoms exit through a slit in the bottom of the head. The downstream gas flow contains atomic “radicals” of the gases, but there are no damaging high-energy particles, ions, or hot electrons in the downstream – only excited atomic radicals ready to modify the surface immediately below.

The base of the Plasma Head is designed to create an air exclusion zone between the head and the sample by the flow of downstream gas.

The plasma head is cooled by circulating CDA.

The plasma head assembly consists of the following components:

1. 105mm Plasma Head
2. Plasma Cell Assembly
3. Rear cooling block
