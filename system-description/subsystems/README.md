# Subsystems

The ONTOS _CLEAN_ is comprised of 11 distinct subsystems

1. [**3-Axis Stage Assembly**](1.-axis-stage.md)**:** This assembly is for precise movement control in three dimensions of the stage, ensuring accurate positioning during processing.
2. [**Frame Assembly**](2.-frame-assembly.md)**:** The frame assembly provides structural integrity and support, forming the foundational framework for the entire system.
3. [**Control Chassis Assembly**](3.-control-chassis.md)**:** This assembly houses the controls for the gas controls, RF controls, as well as system operations, contributing to the overall management of the Ontos3.
4. [**Vacuum Capacitor Matchbox**](4.-vacuum-cap-matchbox-assembly.md)**:** Vital for maintaining a steady RF supply, the matchbox ensures efficient impedance matching in the system.
5. [**A/C Distribution Box**](5.-a-c-distribution-box.md)**:** Responsible for effective power distribution, this component ensures a stable and reliable power supply to the system's various elements.
6. [**Upper Control Panel**](6.-upper-control-panel.md)**:** The upper control panel hosts several controls related to gas controls as well as the stage controller.&#x20;
7. [**Touchscreen Computer & Controller**](7.-touchscreen-computer-and-controller.md)**:** This interactive interface serves as the system's command center via the ONTOS _CLEAN_ software, enabling users to control and monitor the system.
8. [**Signal Tower**](8.-signal-tower.md)**:** The signal tower provides visual indications, alerting users to the system's status and any relevant notifications.
9. [**Plasma Head Assembly**](9.-plasma-head-assembly.md)**:** This assembly facilitates plasma generation and is pivotal to the processing of substrates.
10. [**Crash Avoidance System (Optional)**](10.-crash-avoidance-system.md)**:** Ensuring safety during operation, this system utilizes sensors and algorithms to prevent collisions or mishaps of substrates with the plasma head.
11. [**Film Sense Ellipsometer**](11.-elipsometry-system.md)**:** This component contributes to the precision of the system by measuring and analyzing process results via ellipsometry, aiding in achieving desired outcomes.
