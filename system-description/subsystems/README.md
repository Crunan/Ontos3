# Subsystems

The ONTOS _Clean_ system is comprised of 11 distinct subsystems, each playing a crucial role in its functionality:

1. [**3-Axis Stage Assembly**](1.-axis-stage.md)**:** This assembly is for precise movement control in three dimensions of the stage, ensuring accurate positioning during processing.
2. [**Frame Assembly**](broken-reference)**:** The frame assembly provides structural integrity and support, forming the foundational framework for the entire system.
3. [**Control Chassis Assembly**](broken-reference)**:** This assembly houses the controls for the gas controls, RF controls, as well as system operations, contributing to the overall management of the Ontos3.
4. [**Vacuum Capacitor Matchbox**](3.-vacuum-cap-matchbox-assembly.md)**:** Vital for maintaining a steady RF supply, the matchbox ensures efficient impedance matching in the system.
5. [**A/C Distribution Box**](4.-a-c-distribution-box.md)**:** Responsible for effective power distribution, this component ensures a stable and reliable power supply to the system's various elements.
6. [**Upper Control Panel**](5.-upper-control-panel.md)**:** The upper control panel hosts several controls related to gas controls as well as the stage controller.&#x20;
7. [**Touchscreen Computer & Controller**](6.-touchscreen-computer-and-controller.md)**:** This interactive interface serves as the system's command center via the ONTOS _Clean_ software, enabling users to control and monitor the system.
8. [**Signal Tower**](7.-signal-tower.md)**:** The signal tower provides visual indications, alerting users to the system's status and any relevant notifications.
9. [**Plasma Head Assembly**](8.-plasma-head-assembly.md)**:** This assembly facilitates plasma generation and is pivotal to the processing of substrates.
10. [**Crash Avoidance System (Optional)**](9.-crash-avoidance-system.md)**:** Ensuring safety during operation, this system utilizes sensors and algorithms to prevent collisions or mishaps of substrates with the plasma head.
11. [**Film Sense Ellipsometer**](10.-elipsometry-system.md)**:** This component contributes to the precision of the system by measuring and analyzing process results via ellipsometry, aiding in achieving desired outcomes.

Each of these subsystems is meticulously designed and integrated to collectively deliver the advanced capabilities of the ONTOS _Clean_ system.
