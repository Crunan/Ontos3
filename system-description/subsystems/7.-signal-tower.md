**Section 7: Signal Tower**

The Signal Tower subsystem provides a dynamic visual indicator that efficiently communicates the operational status of the tool. Through a combination of LED lights, the Signal Tower conveys crucial information to users.

**7.1 Operational Status Indicators**

The Signal Tower subsystem employs a trio of LED lights, each with a specific color to convey information about the tool's status:

* **Green Light:** A green light signifies that the Plasma is active and fully operational. This indicator provides reassurance of the ongoing process.
* **Amber Light:** An amber light serves as an indicator that the system is in an idle state, ready for commands. This color communicates readiness and availability.
* **Red Light:** The red light plays a dual role as an indicator. It can signal an error state that requires attention or indicate the presence of an open door. The red light ensures that critical conditions are promptly recognized.
