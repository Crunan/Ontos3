# ðŸŸ¡ Vacuum Cap Matchbox Assembly - Overview

This module functions as an intermediary between the RF Generator Module and the Plasma Head, receiving RF power from the generator, refining the RF signal, and transmitting the optimized signal to the Plasma Head.

The signal conditioning process aligns the variable impedance of the Plasma Head with that of the RF Generator Module, effectively minimizing any reflected RF energy.

Cooperating with the RF Generator Module, this module engages in an ongoing process of monitoring reflected power and conducting network tuning through a closed-loop feedback mechanism.

Depending on your specific configuration, one matchbox per plasma head and Control chassis combination may be employed..

The Matchbox Assembly is made up of the following components:

1. Matchbox Enclosure
2. Matchbox Cover
3. [Vacuum Cap Matchbox Component Group](broken-reference)
