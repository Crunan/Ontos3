# ðŸ”´ Crash Avoidance System

(OPTIONAL)

The Ontos3 can be outfitted with a Crash Avoidance System. The system consists of two towers which house a reflective laser sensor system. The Crash Avoidance System will allow for a pre-scan collision test which ensures that the Operator inputs have been correctly entered. If any mistake is made during setup for the _Gap_ and _Thickness_ fields, the Crash Avoidance System will detect an imminent crash during the collision test and stop all motors. The Operator will be informed on the interface that the Laser was tripped and will be required to acknowledge the error. Upon acknowledging, the system will return to the Load position and be ready for another collision test. The laser tower sensors can be seen inside the OntosTT below.
