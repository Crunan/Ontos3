# What is the Ontos3?

The Ontos3 Atmospheric Plasma Surface Preparation System creates a plasma using a mixture of process gases to clean the surface, reduce native oxides, activate surfaces, or otherwise prepare a sample surface prior to the next process step.&#x20;

Typical downstream processes might include soldering, joining, bonding, etching, deposition, plating, or other semiconductor fabrication or assembly steps.&#x20;

The following is a brief description of the equipmentâ€™s subsystems and major components. The Ontos3has two tool sizes, 200mm and 300mm&#x20;
