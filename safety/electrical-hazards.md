# âš¡ Electrical Hazards

{% hint style="info" %}
Warning symbols such as these may be installed on your machine to indicate areas of specific electrical hazard.
{% endhint %}

Several areas of the machine may have voltages present which could deliver dangerous or lethal shocks. Of greatest concern are the Radio Frequency (RF) Generator and the RF Impedance Matching Network Module for the plasma source.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Module covers are not to be removed, except by factory-trained personnel.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not remove any RF cabling unless the system is powered down and the mains power cable is disconnected from the power source.
{% endhint %}

Operating voltage is likewise present at all portions of the control rack and at all motors and actuators inside the process enclosure. These areas are protected by covers and/or interlocks which should always be installed and functional during machine operation.&#x20;
