# Emergency Power Off (EPO) Functionality

The ONTOS _CLEAN_ incorporates a critical safety feature known as the Emergency Power Off (EPO) button. This red button is strategically positioned for swift access and is an essential element of ensuring operator and equipment safety.

**Activating EPO:** In situations demanding immediate halting of the machine due to an emergency, you can activate the EPO button. A simple press of the red Emergency Power Off button will instantly halt the system's operation.

**Releasing the EPO Button:** Once activated, the EPO button needs to be reset before the system can resume normal operations. To release the EPO button, gently twist it clockwise. This motion will cause the button to pop back out, signaling that the emergency shutdown state has been disengaged.

**Restoring System Power:** After the EPO button has been engaged and the system is shut down, complete power restoration is a multi-step process. To bring the system back online, follow these steps:

The EPO button serves as a crucial tool to swiftly mitigate risks during emergencies. Its proper usage and understanding ensure the safety for both operators and the equipment.
