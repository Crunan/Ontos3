# Servicing the system

Proper servicing and maintenance of the ONTOS _CLEAN_ is a part of keeping the system at optimal performance. While a few functional checks are permissible for users, the majority of service and maintenance tasks should only be undertaken by certified and OES-trained technicians. It is imperative that these personnel possess the training and experience to effectively mitigate all potential hazards.

**User-Performed Functional Checks:** Certain functional checks outlined in the Servicing section of this manual can be conducted by users. These checks are detailed to provide an understanding of the limited tasks that users can safely perform. They contribute to basic operational monitoring and adherence to routine maintenance practices.

**Qualified Service Technicians:** All service and maintenance activities beyond the scope of user-performed checks should be entrusted only to qualified OES-trained technicians. These professionals possess the expertise to identify, address, and rectify complex technical issues while adhering to appropriate safety protocols.
