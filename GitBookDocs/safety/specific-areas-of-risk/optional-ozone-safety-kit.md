# Optional Ozone Safety Kit

The Ozone Safety Kit, available as an optional package, offers users an additional layer of safety by facilitating the measurement and monitoring of Ozone levels within specific areas of the ONTOS _CLEAN_. This optional kit features an External Ozone Sensor, designed to detect and quantify Ozone concentrations that could potentially impact the safety of operators or other individuals present in the vicinity of the equipment.

**Key Components of the Optional Kit:**

* **External Ozone Sensor:** Engineered to detect the presence of Ozone, this sensor plays a pivotal role in enhancing safety measures. Upon detecting Ozone, the sensor acts as a safeguard by promptly causing an ESTOP condition through the interlock circuit.

**Verifying Inclusion:** To determine whether your ONTOS _CLEAN_ includes the Optional Ozone Safety Kit, please refer to your purchase order or the documentation provided upon acquisition.

**Safety Considerations:** It's important to reiterate that the use of gases other than those explicitly mentioned in the manual could result in warranty voidance and potentially introduce significant safety risks. Maintaining strict adherence to the designated gases and safety measures ensures a secure operational environment and the longevity of your ONTOS _CLEAN_.
