# Gaseous and Chemical Hazards

The ONTOS _CLEAN_ incorporates specific safety mechanisms that ensure a secure operational environment, provided that gases are used and managed in strict accordance with this manual. It's crucial to recognize that the safety features are designed based on the designated gases outlined here.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
&#x20;**Using any other gases not specified in this manual will not be covered by the system's safety design features and will void the warranty.**
{% endhint %}

**Unapproved Gas Usage:** Employing gases other than those specified in this manual is not authorized by OES (Ontos Equipment Systems). Doing so could lead to potential safety hazards, equipment damage, and may even void the warranty of the equipment. For requests to qualify and approve additional gases, please contact us at [support@ontosplasma.com](mailto:support@ontosplasma.com).

**Exhaust System Connection:** To maintain a safe operational environment, the process enclosure should be seamlessly connected to your organization's factory exhaust system. It's important to verify the specific requirements relevant to your organization and location to ensure compliance with safety standards.

**User-Installed Hardware Interlocks:** In addition to the system's inherent safety features, users may also incorporate their own hardware interlocks for enhanced safety measures. Some examples of such interlocks include:

* Exhaust monitoring based on flow rate or differential pressure.
* Integration of external gas sensors to ensure accurate detection and monitoring.

By adhering to the specified gases, exhaust system guidelines, and incorporating supplementary interlocks where appropriate, you contribute to creating a safer operational environment and safeguard the longevity and reliability of your ONTOS _CLEAN_.
