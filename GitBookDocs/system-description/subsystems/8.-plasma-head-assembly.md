# ðŸŸ£ 8. Plasma Head Assembly

**Section 8: Plasma Head**

The Plasma Head is a core module responsible for generating a controlled plasma plume. The Plasma Head seamlessly combines process gases and RF power to initiate a highly controlled reaction within a confined chamber.

**8.1 Controlled Plasma Generation**

The Plasma Head module orchestrates the fusion of process gases and RF power to establish a plasma glow discharge within a energetic environment which activates the gas species as they flow through the internal chamber. This discharge generates a controlled and highly energetic environment for surface modification processes.

**8.2 Downstream Gas Flow**

As part of its operation, the Plasma Head promotes the excitation of "downstream" gas atoms. Exiting through a dedicated slit at the bottom, the downstream gas flow is enriched with atomic "radicals" of the gases. Notably, this downstream gas flow is void of damaging high-energy particles, ions, or hot electrons. Instead, it comprises excited atomic radicals ready to enact surface modifications.

**8.3 Air Exclusion Zone Design**

The base of the Plasma Head features an ingeniously designed mechanism that creates an air exclusion zone between the head and the sample. This is achieved through the arranged flow of downstream gas. This exclusionary environment plays a role in shielding the process from undesired interactions, ensuring the purity and precision of surface modification processes.

**8.4 Efficient Cooling Mechanism**

To maintain optimal operational conditions, the Plasma Head is equipped with a cooling system. Circulating Clean Dry Air (CDA), the cooling mechanism effectively dissipates heat, safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the module, as well as maintaining consistent internal plasma conditions.
