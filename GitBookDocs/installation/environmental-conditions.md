# Environmental Conditions

To achieve optimal performance of the ONTOS _CLEAN_, it is advisable to maintain a controlled and suitable environment indoors at an as outlined below:

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Clean Room Classification:** The system should be installed within a clean room environment with a minimum classification of class 10,000 (ISO 7). Depending on application, consider a higher classification, such as class 100 (ISO 5).
* **Operating Altitude:** This system is designed to operate effectively at altitudes up to 2000 meters (6562 feet) above sea level. Please ensure that the system is used within this specified altitude range for optimal performance and safety.
* **Room Temperature Range:** For optimal performance and safety, maintain a room temperature between 18째C (64째F) and 40째C (104째F). Operating the system within this temperature range ensures consistent and reliable operation.
* **Room Humidity Range:** Maintain a room humidity range below 70% to guarantee consistent and reliable operation of the system. Operating the system within this humidity range ensures consistent and reliable operation.
* **Laminar Flow Area:** It is recommended that the system is positioned within a laminar flow area with an airspeed ranging between 0.3 to 0.5 meters per second (12 to 18 inches per second). This controlled airflow helps maintain a clean and stable operational environment.
* **Exhaust System Connection:** The system must be connected to a proper exhaust system to facilitate the efficient removal of process byproducts and gases, ensuring a controlled environment.&#x20;
* **Seismic Anchoring:** Seismic anchor points are provided for use where required. [See seismic anchoring installation section.](seismic-anchoring-installation.md)
* **Servicing Accessibility:** Ensure that the Control Rack can be fully extended for servicing purposes.&#x20;
* **Pollution Degree:** The intended operating environment for this system is a clean room with a pollution degree rating of 1. In such a controlled and low-pollution setting, the system is designed to maintain its performance and reliability.&#x20;
