# Environmental Conditions

To achieve optimal performance of the ONTOS _CLEAN_, it is advisable to maintain a controlled and suitable environment as outlined below:

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Clean Room Classification:** The system must be installed within a clean room environment with a minimum classification of class 10,000 (ISO 7). Depending on application, consider a higher classification, such as class 100 (ISO 5).
* **Room Temperature Range:** Maintain a room temperature between 18°C (64°F) and 24°C (75°F) to guarantee consistent and reliable operation of the system.
* **Room Humidity Range:** Maintain a room humidity range below 70% to guarantee consistent and reliable operation of the system.
* **Laminar Flow Area:** It is recommended that the system is positioned within a laminar flow area with an airspeed ranging between 0.3 to 0.5 meters per second (12 to 18 inches per second). This controlled airflow helps maintain a clean and stable operational environment.
* **Exhaust System Connection:** The system must be connected to a proper exhaust system to facilitate the efficient removal of process byproducts and gases, ensuring a controlled environment.
* **Seismic Anchoring:** Seismic anchor points are provided for use where required.
* **Servicing Accessibility:** Ensure that the Control Rack can be fully extended for servicing purposes. OES Recommends utilizing flexible Teflon lines for gas connections to enable proper access and maintenance.
