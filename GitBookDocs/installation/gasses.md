# Gasses

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **During installation, pay close attention to input gasses and gas type.** &#x20;
* **Incorrectly set pressure lines may result in a safety hazard and/or equipment damage.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **Use of any other gases than those described in this manual is not authorized by OES and may result in safety hazards and/or equipment damage as well as voidance of warranty.**
*   **The minimum combined Gas flow for carrier gasses is factory set to prevent** &#x20;

    **damage to the Plasma Head.**
* **The amount of Hydrogen within the Helium typically is between 3% & 5%, dependent upon local LEL standards. Please consult your local gas supplier for information regarding your area.**
