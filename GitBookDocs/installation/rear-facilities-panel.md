# Rear Facilities Panel

**Gas Ports and Connections**

Proper gas connections are vital for the optimal functioning of the ONTOS _CLEAN_. Follow these guidelines for secure and efficient gas handling:

* **Gas Ports Location:** The back panel of the ONTOS _CLEAN_ houses six input gas ports and one output gas port (chuck vacuum).
* **Fitting Type:** The six input gas ports are equipped with ¼” Swagelok® compression fittings.
* **Gas Pressure:** Operate the six gases in the system at a pressure of 20 PSI (1.4 bar).
* **Recommended Gas Quality:** OES recommends the use of Ultra-High Purity (UHP) gases and point-of-use filters to ensure gas quality.
* **Flow Rate and Pressure Compatibility:** See [Gasses ](gasses.md)for flow specs and compatibility.
* **Regulator Installation:** Install a stainless-steel regulator with a maximum range of 0 to 100 PSI (0 to 6.9 bar) on the delivery source for each gas. Ideally, the regulator would be mounted near the Ontos _CLEAN_ for operator verification.
* **Isolation Valve:** Additionally, consider installing a stainless-steel isolation valve downstream of the regulator. This valve allows gas to be switched on/off without adjusting the regulator, enabling efficient bottle changes without extensive purging before plasma resumption.
* **Chase Installation:** If the delivery source is located in a chase, ensure the installation of a valve within the clean room area near the system connections.
