# Seismic Anchoring Installation

The ONTOS _CLEAN_ must be securely anchored to prevent movement or displacement during seismic events. Proper seismic anchoring is crucial to ensure the safety of personnel, protect the equipment, and maintain the system's operational integrity. This section outlines the guidelines and procedures for effectively anchoring the ONTOS _CLEAN_ in seismic-prone regions.

#### Seismic Anchoring Requirements

Before proceeding with the seismic anchoring process, it is essential to understand the seismic requirements specific to your location and facility. Local building codes, regulations, and seismic design criteria should be consulted to determine the necessary anchoring specifications. The goal is to ensure that the tool remains stable and intact even in the event of an earthquake.

* **Double-Check:** Inspect the anchoring brackets, bolts, and nuts to confirm that they are properly installed and tightened according to the manufacturer's instructions.
* **Stability Test:** Gently apply pressure to the ONTOS _CLEAN_ to check for any movement or instability. The system should remain firmly anchored.
* **Professional Review:** If required by local regulations, seek the expertise of a professional engineer or seismic expert to review and verify the adequacy of the anchoring installation.
