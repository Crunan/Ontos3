# Engineer Mode

**Engineer Mode Features**

The Engineer mode within the ONTOS _CLEAN_ software is designed to provide engineers with advanced controls and functionalities for system configuration and maintenance. Engineers have access to a comprehensive set of tools that allow for in-depth adjustments and fine-tuning of the system's parameters. Below are the key features available in Engineer Mode:

[**Advanced System Controls**](accessing-engineer-mode.md)**:** Engineer Mode provides a wide range of controls that enable engineers to configure and fine-tune various aspects of the system, including gas flow rates, RF power, and advanced tuning parameters.

[**MFC Setpoint Adjustment:**](broken-reference) Engineers can adjust the setpoints of Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) by clicking the associated Enter button for a specific MFC. This precision control allows for precise gas flow rate configuration.

[**Automatic Tuning:**](auto-tune.md) Engineers can toggle the \[AUTO TUNE] button to activate or deactivate the automatic tuning feature. This functionality optimizes system performance by automatically adjusting tuning parameters.

[**Manual Matchbox Tuning**](manual-tuning.md)**:** Engineer Mode offers manual control over Matchbox tuning. The interface features arrows that engineers can click to decrease or increase the Matchbox tuning percentage, facilitating precise adjustment of RF power.

[**USB Communication Setup**](connection-to-a-communication-port.md)**:** Engineers have access to the communication link between the ONTOS Clean application and the control rack by selecting an available port from the dropdown menu and clicking the \[CONNECT] button.

**Additional Stage Controls:** Engineers have access to specialized stage controls such as \[SET TWO SPOT] and \[SET DIAMETER], which allow for advanced adjustments to the stage configuration.

**Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Engineers can access additional troubleshooting tools and diagnostic information, facilitating quick identification and resolution of issues.

**Flexible Configuration:** Engineer Mode offers the flexibility to customize system settings and configurations to meet specific processing requirements.

The Engineer mode empowers engineers with the tools needed to fine-tune recipes, optimize, and maintain the ONTOS _CLEAN_.
