# Lift Pins

The lift pins play a pivotal role in loading and unloading substrates onto the stage chuck. Here's how to effectively use them:

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **Function of Lift Pins:**
   * The lift pins are designed to facilitate the loading and unloading of substrates onto the stage chuck.
2. **Lift Pins Button:**
   * The **\[LIFT PINS]** button is initially enabled by default once the stage is initialized.
3. **Loading Substrate:**
   * When the **\[LIFT PINS]** button is enabled (green light is illuminated), clicking it will smoothly position a loaded substrate onto the chuck.
4. **Vacuum Behavior:**
   * Whenever the **\[LIFT PINS]** function is enabled, the chuck vacuum will be automatically turned off. This action occurs irrespective of whether the manual vacuum button is activated.
