# Performance Limitation

The performance and output of the ONTOS _CLEAN_ are subject to the environmental conditions in which the system is operated. It is important to understand that the tool's capabilities and results are directly influenced by the surrounding environment and operational parameters.

Users should be aware that the tool's performance cannot exceed the limitations set by the specific [environmental conditions](../installation/environmental-conditions.md). While the ONTOS _CLEAN_ is designed to deliver reliable and consistent results, its performance is constrained by the conditions it operates within.

We strongly recommend that users carefully consider the environmental conditions in which the ONTOS _CLEAN_ will be used. Users are expected to ensure that the chosen operational environment aligns with the tool's specifications and recommended operating parameters. Failure to do so may lead to suboptimal results or performance that falls short of expectations.

Should you have any questions or require guidance on configuring the appropriate environmental conditions for your system, please feel free to contact our support team at [support@set-na.com](mailto:support@set-na.com).&#x20;

OES recommends the following guidelines for [Environmental Conditions](../installation/environmental-conditions.md).
