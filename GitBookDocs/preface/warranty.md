# Warranty

**GENERAL CONDITIONS OF WARRANTY**

At OES, we stand behind the quality of our machines and want to ensure your satisfaction. Your machine is warranted for 1 year against all defects in construction, parts, and labor. The warranty period starts from the date the machine receives its final acceptance at your site. We want to promptly address any concerns, so please note that the acceptance date should not exceed 6 months from the delivery date, unless we agree otherwise in writing.

To maintain the warranty's validity and ensure your machine operates optimally, please refrain from any intervention or modification of parts or electronic control circuits without prior written permission from OES. Specifically, tampering with the adjustment screws, which are sealed with materials like wax or varnish, will void the warranty.

For your convenience, warranty clauses specific to each type of machine are outlined in the corresponding technical document. We recommend carefully reviewing this information, especially details regarding the initial setup of certain equipment.

{% hint style="info" %}
For certain pieces of equipment, this warranty is only valid if the machine is returned to our workshop. If the service call is carried out on-site, the technician's travel expenses will be billed to the user.

Your satisfaction and trust are essential to us, and we are committed to providing you with reliable machines and excellent service. If you have any questions about the warranty or need assistance with your equipment, please feel free to contact our dedicated support team. Thank you for choosing OES as your partner in productivity!
