**Service Calls**

To ensure the best support experience for all our valued customers, we kindly request that you follow these simple steps when requesting a service call:

1. Reach out to our OES authorized after-sales technician by sending an email to [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com) to initiate the service call process.
2. For service calls outside the warranty period, please include an order number in your email. This will help expedite the settlement process.

We genuinely appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these guidelines, as they allow us to serve you better. By working together, we can ensure that your service needs are promptly addressed.
