2. **Close Gas Valve on Old Bottle**: Ensure that the gas valve on the bottle that needs to be changed out is completely closed.
3. **Remove Regulator Assembly**: Using an adjustable wrench, carefully remove the regulator assembly from the old gas bottle. Make sure to do this with caution to avoid any damage or gas leakage.
4. **Replace Empty Tank**: Remove the empty gas tank and replace it with a new, properly secured gas bottle.
5. **Attach Regulator Assembly**: With the new gas bottle in place, use the adjustable wrench to securely attach the regulator assembly. Make sure it is tightened properly to prevent gas leaks.
6. **Open Tank Valve**: Open the valve on the new gas bottle. This will allow gas to flow into the regulator assembly.
7. **Check for Leaks**: Carefully check for any gas leaks at the connection between the regulator and the gas bottle. If you detect any leaks, take immediate action to address the issue before proceeding.
8. **Set Bottle Pressure**: Ensure that the pressure setting on the gas bottle is correctly configured according to system requirements.
9. **Open Valve to Machine**: Now, open the valve on the machine that was turned off in step 1. This will allow gas to flow from the new bottle to the machine.
