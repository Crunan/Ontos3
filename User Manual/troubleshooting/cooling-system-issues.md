# Cooling System Issues

#### Plasma head temperature should normally stay below 45°C, even when running continuously. If you notice the head temperature going above this, or if you get an error message due to reaching the maximum temperature (60°C), a cooling system issue is indicated.

#### Please call or email service at [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com).

Note: You can continue to run the system intermittently, watching closely that the head temperature does not exceed 40°C; however, the cooling system should be checked and repaired as soon as possible. Please call Maintenance.
