# Plasma Issue #2

**Issue #2: If plasma is RUNNING, but the current recipe does not light the plasma (The **_**Plasma On**_** indicator light is not violet) then it could be that the gas values are outside the operating range of the plasma head.**

**Manually enter 10 SLPM for Helium per section 7 - Engineer mode.**

**Manually enter 0.1 SLPM for Nitrogen per section per 7 - Engineer mode (Maximum depends on Helium flow but is generally under 0.25 SLPM**

**Only if the system is equipped with the Ozone option, manually enter 0.1 SLPM for Oxygen per section 7 - Engineer mode (maximum depends on Helium flow but is generally under 0.25 SLPM.)**

**Do not run oxygen and hydrogen together in a single process as this can cause an explosion and may damage the plasma head. Do not run oxygen unless the Optional O2 gas kit has been installed (prevents oxygen and hydrogen from running at same time).**



**Run plasma per section 07.1.5 -Run Plasma â€“ Engineer mode**

**If this does not activate the plasma, call or email service at** [**service@set-na.com**](mailto:service@set-na.com)**.**
