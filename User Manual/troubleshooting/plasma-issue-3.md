# Plasma Issue #3

**ssue #3: If plasma is RUNNNING, but then goes out during a cycle, an error message will appear (most typically, the gas supply has been interrupted by an empty gas cylinder). check the following:**

**Gas flow compliance may be out of spec for too long. This can be caused by:**

**Empty gas cylinder.**

**Noise spikes in the environment**

**Compliance limit set too tight for the gas flow setting (i.e., if trying to control flow to less than 10% of the max range of the MFC). Call or email service before changing compliance settings.**

**Check the temperature of the source, which is displayed in process window. If it is near 60C, the system may be shutting down to prevent plasma head overheating. Check that cooling water is circulating normally.**

**A system interlock may be opening.**

**check all safety systems and then repeat section 7.1.5 - Running Plasma â€“ Engineer Mode**

**If this does not resolve the issue, call or email service at** [**service@set-na.com**](mailto:service@set-na.com)**.**
