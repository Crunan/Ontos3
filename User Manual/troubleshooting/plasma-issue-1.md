# Plasma Issue #1

### Plasma issues <a href="#_toc84500408" id="_toc84500408"></a>

Note: In EVERY recipe, MFC#1 must have some flow setting to open the manifold gate valve. A setting of 0.00 for MFC#1 will cause the manifold to remain closed and gas pressure from the other flows will only build up behind the valve, eventually leading to a non-flow condition and an error message

**Issue #1: If plasma fails to activate, (The **_**Plasma On**_** indicator light is not violet) a pop-up window will display information regarding what may have gone wrong. Common issues are the following: the gas supply lines are not turned on, the flow of MFC#1 (Helium) is set to 0.00, RF Power is set to 0.00, No active recipe has been loaded.**

**Manually enter 10 SLPM for Helium and 80 watts for RF Power. Run plasma per section 07.1.5 -Run Plasma â€“ Engineer mode.**

**If this does not activate the plasma, call or email service at** [**service@set-na.com**](mailto:service@set-na.com)**.**
