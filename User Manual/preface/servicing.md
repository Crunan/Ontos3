# Servicing

**Service Calls**

In order to avoid abuse, every request for the service call of an OES authorized after sales technician must be confirmed via email. No other form of request will be acknowledged. In addition, for service calls outside the warranty period, the email should include an order number in order to facilitate rapid settlement. The point-of-contact for service work is [service@set-na.com](mailto:service@set-na.com).

The payment of service calls carried out outside the warranty period is to be made upon receipt of our invoice. No service calls will be carried out if these conditions are not observed.
