# Rear Service Panel

The four input gas ports and one output gas port (chuck vacuum) are located on the back panel of the OntosTT. The fittings used for the four input gas ports are ¼” Swagelok® compression fittings. The four gases used in the system are typically operated at a pressure of 20 PSI (1.4 bar). OES suggests that UHP gases and point-of-use filters be used. All gas flow rates should be capable of 20 SLPM at 20 PSI.

A stainless-steel regulator with a maximum range of 0 to 100 PSI (0 to 6.9 bar) must be installed on the delivery source for each gas. In addition, a stainless-steel shut-off valve may be installed immediately downstream of the regulator to allow gas to be switched on/off without adjusting the regulator. This can enable changing out of bottles without the need to purge for a long period before resuming plasma.

If the delivery source is located in a chase, then a valve should be installed inside the clean room area near the system connections.
