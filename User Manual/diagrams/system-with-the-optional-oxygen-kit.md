# System with the Optional Oxygen Kit

For systems with the optional Oxygen kit: there are “two” interlocks which must be satisfied for process to run.

The red EMO (Emergency-Stop) button must be released per step 2.1.5.

Note: The EMO button occasionally gets accidentally bumped and disconnects and it may not be apparent that it has been activated.

The Ozone sensor display must be green or yellow at the bottom of the scale, this is the safe zone.

If excessive Ozone is being sensed in the vicinity of the OntosTT, the display will be red, this is unsafe and a ESTOP will be triggered. This may be an indication of insufficient exhaust. Ozone must be cleared from the area until the Ozone scale drops back into the yellow or green causing the green LED on the front panel to come on again.
