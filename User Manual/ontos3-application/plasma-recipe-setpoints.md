# Plasma Recipe Setpoints

* GAS FLOW: Gas flow is programmed in Standard Liter(s) per Minute (SLPM). The gas #1 is the carrier gas. Carrier gas is Helium and it is mandatory to gas #1 to a value equal or higher than 10 SLPM whatever chemistry is used for a given process. As a consequence, Helium/Hydrogen, Nitrogen, or Oxygen cannot be used alone (without Gas #1).
* RF POWER: The Radio-Frequency Power is set in Watts.
* MB TUNER: The Plasma Head impedance varies with the gas mixture; therefore, an impedance matching network is required to minimize the reflected power. The Matchbox Tuner (MB Tuner) can accomplish this and can be preset by the engineer to minimize the plasma activation time.
