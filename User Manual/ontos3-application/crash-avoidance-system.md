# Crash Avoidance System

Note: _The Crash Avoidance_ _System option can only be selected by an Engineer level access._

#### The _Crash Avoidance_ _System_ option will make active the Crash Avoidance System sensors. The Crash Avoidance System is intended to protect both the Plasma Head and the Substrate from collision in the case where the Operator inputs have been incorrectly assessed.



Figure 61: Crash Avoidance System

#### With the Crash Avoidance System active, the system will attempt a Collision Test. The stage chuck will elevate to the max height in the Z-Axis, then it will begin to approach the plasma head. If the Stage Inputs for _Gap_ and _Thickness_ have been correctly set, the substrate on the chuck will pass under the plasma head. If there has been a miscalculation, the Laser on the Crash Avoidance System will detect an imminent collision and stop all stage movement.

#### When a crash has been prevented, the tool will indicate this by an error code which states “LASER TRIPPED” as well as the Indicator box for the Laser Sense will be lit Red as seen in **Figure** **62**.

#### Click the Acknowledge button in the Error Code section to return the stage to the Load position.

#### Correctly determine the substrate gap and thickness and enter the new values.

#### Repeat the Collision test to ensure the entered values will allow the substrate to pass underneath the plasma head.

Note: The Laser Sense indicator box will light up green, () to indicate the Crash Avoidance System is active.
