**CONDITIONS OF OWNERSHIP**

After the delivery and installation of the equipment, OES and its representatives retain ownership of the equipment until complete payment for it has been received. Furthermore, in the eventuality of non-payment of amounts due, OES and its representatives will not honor the warranty. The warranty will, however, be honored once payment has been made, without extending the warranty by the length of time of the overdue payment.
