# Safety Interlock System for Systems with Optional Oxygen Kits

In systems equipped with the optional Oxygen kit, an additional layer of safety is introduced through a more comprehensive interlock configuration. Two interlock conditions must be met to ensure the secure operation of the process:

1. **Release the EMO Button:**
   * Similar to the base system, ensure that the red Emergency-Stop (EMO) button is released before initiating any process. Keep in mind that accidental engagement of the EMO button can occur, causing unexpected interruptions.
2. **Ozone Sensor Display:**
   * The Ozone sensor display, located at the bottom of the scale, should ideally be green or yellow. This indicates a safe zone for operation.
   * In the event that excessive Ozone is detected in the vicinity of the OntosTT, the Ozone sensor display will turn red, indicating an unsafe condition. This situation might arise due to insufficient exhaust. If the Ozone scale becomes red, an Emergency Stop (ESTOP) will be triggered as a safety precaution.
   * To address excessive Ozone, the area needs to be cleared until the Ozone scale drops back into the yellow or green range. As the scale returns to the safe zone, the green LED on the front panel will illuminate again, indicating the resumption of safe conditions.

Please bear in mind that the safety interlock system with the optional Oxygen kit is designed to ensure a higher level of safety during operation. By adhering to these interlock requirements, you contribute to the secure and uninterrupted functioning of the OntosTT system.
