For base systems without the optional Oxygen kit there is “one” interlock which must be satisfied for the process to run. The red EPO button must be released per step 2.1.5.

Note: The EPO button occasionally gets accidentally bumped and disconnects and it may not be apparent that it has been activated.

Refer to the diagram in Figure 95 to see the Standard Interlock Configuration.
